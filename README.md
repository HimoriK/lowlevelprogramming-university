NOTICE2: Please notice that low-level programming is out of trend and currently there are not many companies hiring low-level developer. It is getting harder for me to find a job.
If you haven't started a professional career yet, I would like to recommend you consider other fields either carefully.

# Low-Level Programming University

## What is it?

This page cannot include every link/book/course. For example, this page introduces Arduino but there is not detailed information about Arduino and embedded systems. You should go further yourself. You have the keyword "Arduino" with which you can start. So your next step is probably googling Arduino, buying a kit, and doing something for yourself, not collecting links or free books. Please remember this page is just a roadmap for beginners.

Low-level programming is a part of computer science.
Absolutely it would be much better to get education in computer science first.
* [Free self-taught education in Computer Science!](https://github.com/HimoriK/computer-science)


## What is the Low-Level?

* [Wikipedia: Low-level programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language)

Yes, systems programming is a very close concept to low-level programming. This page includes the hardware design and firmware development that is not included in systems programming.
* [Wikipedia: System programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_programming)

Finally, this page includes topics ranging from hardware components to the Linux kernel. That is a huge range of layers. A one page document can never cover the details of all the layers, so the aim of this document is to serve as a starting point for low-level programming.

## Theory

There are two background theories to low-level programming:
* Computer Architecture
* Operating Systems

I think the best way to learn theory is by taking a course. Reading books is not bad but takes too much time and effort. You can attend school or find a tutorial online.
Theory is theory. I don't think you need to get an A+ in class, just understand the big picture.
You'll get improve with experience.

Some topics to study
* Computer Architecture
  * Computer Organization and Design, Fourth Edition: The Hardware/Software Interface
* Recommended Courses
   * [CS401: Operating Systems from saylor.org](https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=94)
* General Programming Skill
   * [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs)
      * It's about how to be a good Software programmer. You need not only theory but only technique because programming is a kind of craftwork.
      * [I've solved about 80% exercises. It should be worth to try every single exercise.](https://github.com/gurugio/sicp_exercise)
* Hardware Design
   * Build Your Own 8086 Microprocessor Kit
      * If you don't build your HW board, you don't understand what physical memory mapped device is.
      * Modern APs includes so many IPs. So you don't have a chance to understand how CPU core and peripheral devices are connected.
      * When you build your own 8086 kit, you have a chance to locate each peripheral devices on the physical memory. And you can set how the main HW components (BUS, IRQ, Clock, Power and etc) works with your own eyes.
      * I built the 8086 kit in my University. It was one of the most valuable courses I've ever taken. Try to build your own HW kit. It would be better if the HW is older ans simpler because you should do more for yourself.
      * Google "8086 kit". You would be able to find some web-sites you can buy a HW scheme, parts and manuals.

There is an infinite list of good books. I don't want to say that you should read many books. Just read one book carefully. Whenever you learn a theory, implement simulation code of it. **Implementing one thing is better than knowing one hundred theories.**

## Languages

### Assembly

Learn ARM. It doesn't matter to know assembly language. The essential thing is understanding the internals of a CPU and computer. So you don't need to practice the assembly of the latest CPU. Select 8086 or Cortex-M.

* [8086 assembly programming with emu8086](https://github.com/gurugio/book_assembly_8086)
  * basic concepts of CPU and computer architecture

  * Explains in detail the different concepts that make up computer architecture.
  * The MIPS and ARM edition cover the same topics but by dissecting a different architecture.
  * Both editions contain x86 examples

### C language

There is no shortcut. Just read the entire book and solve all the exercises.

* [The C Programming Language 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=60R1D2CHBA8DHYT6JNMN) dated

### Rust language

I am sure that the next language for the systems programming would be Rust.
I will make a list what I did to learn Rust.

[Linus Torvalds said "Unless something odd happens, it [Rust] will make it into 6.1."](https://www.zdnet.com/article/linus-torvalds-rust-will-go-into-linux-6-1/)

* [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
  * Mid introduction, wordy & lacks exercises.
* [Easy rust](https://dhghomon.github.io/easy_rust/)
  * A book written in easy English. (Good book, better than main one)
  * Youtube materials provided: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfllocyHVgsRwLkTAhG0E-2QxCf-ozBkk
* [Let's get rusty](https://www.youtube.com/c/LetsGetRusty)
  * There are many Youtubers uploading Rust course but I enjoyed this course most.
  * He has been uploading the latest news for Rust. It's worth subscribing.

## Applications

### Hardware and Firmware

If you want to be an embedded systems engineer, it would be best to start from a simple hardware kit, rather than starting with the latest ARM chipset.

* [Arduino Start Kit](https://www.arduino.cc/)
  * There are many series of Arduinos but "Arduino Start Kit" has the most simple processor(ATmega328P) and guide book
  * ATmega328P has an 8-bit core which is a good place to start digital circuit design and firmware development.
  * You don't need to know how to draw schematics and layouts and assemble the chips.
  * But you do need to know how to read schematics and understand how the chips are connected.
* [8086 manual](https://edge.edx.org/c4x/BITSPilani/EEE231/asset/8086_family_Users_Manual_1_.pdf)
  * If you're a beginner to x86 architecture, 8086 is also very good guide for processor architecture and x86 assembly
* [80386 manual](http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2015/readings/i386.pdf)
  * Best guide for protected mode and paging mechanism of 80x86 processor
  * Web version: https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2011/readings/i386/toc.htm

At this point, you're good to start on the latest ARM or x86 processor.
* https://www.raspberrypi.org/
* https://beagleboard.org/
* https://www.arduino.cc/en/ArduinoCertified/IntelEdison

For example, the Raspberry Pi board has a Cortex-A53 Processor that supports a 64-bit instruction set.
This allows you to experience a modern processor architecture with rPi.
Yes, you can buy it... but... what are you going to do with it?
If you have no target project, you would be likely to throw the board into a drawer and forget it like other gadgets you may have bought before.

So, I recommend one project for you.
* [Making your own kernel](http://wiki.osdev.org/Getting_Started)
  * Good references: https://www.reddit.com/r/osdev/
* [Learning operating system development using Linux kernel and Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os)
  * (description of the project) This is a guide that teaches how to create a simple (OS) kernel from scratch. Each lesson first explains how some kernel feature is implemented in the RPi OS, and then demonstrates how the same functionality works in the Linux kernel.

I've made [a toy kernel](https://github.com/gurugio/caos) that supports 64-bit long mode, paging and simple context switching. Making a toy kernel is good way to understand modern computer architecture and hardware control.

In fact, you have already the latest processor and the latest hardware devices.
Your laptop! Your desktop! You already have all you need in order to start!
The qemu emulator can emulate the latest ARM and Intel processors.
So everything you need is there with toy kernels and documents you can refer to.
Install qemu emulator & make a kernel that boots, turns on paging, & prints data.

Other toy kernels:
* https://littleosbook.github.io/
* https://tuhdo.github.io/os01/

### Linux kernel and device driver

You don't need to make a complete operating system.
Linux development is open source. Participate there.

Some resources for Linux kernel and device driver development from beginner to advanced.
* Books: Read the following topics in order (Modern sources)
  * [A book on Unix Systems]
    * The basic concepts of Unix are applied into all operating systems.
  * [Linux Device Driver Dev](https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Device-Driver-Development-development/dp/1803240067)
    * Make all examples for yourself
  * Linux Kernel Development
    * Read this book and the kernel source v2.6 at the same time
    * Never start with the latest version, v2.6 is enough!
    * Use qemu and gdb to run the kernel source line by line
      * http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11408041/how-to-debug-the-linux-kernel-with-gdb-and-qemu

### Other applications

Yes, you might not be interested in Linux or firmware. If so, you can find other applications:
* Windows systems programming & device drivers
* Reverse engineering & Security

I don't have any knowledge about those applications. Please send me any information for beginners.

**Kernels and drivers are not all of low-level programming.** One more important application of low-level programming is the software-defined storage or distributed filesystem. Detailed descriptions of them is beyond the scope of this document but there is an excellent course where you can try a simple distributed filesystem.

## Future of low-level programming

I do not know the future, but I keep my eye on Rust.
* https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/11/rust-and-the-future-of-systems-programming/

If I could have one week free and alone, I would learn Rust.
That is because Rust is the latest language with which I can develop Linux device drivers.
* https://github.com/tsgates/rust.ko

IoT is new trend, so it's worth to check what OSs are for IoT.
ARM, Samsung and some companies has their own realtime OS but sadly many of them are closed source.
But Linux Foundation also has a solution: Zephyr
* https://www.zephyrproject.org/

Typical cloud servers have many layers; for instance, host OS, KVM driver, qemu process, guest OS and service application. A container has been developed to provide light virtualization. In the near future, a new concept of OS, a so-called library OS or Unikernel, would replace the typical stack of SW for virtualization.
* http://unikernel.org/

Big data and cloud computing require bigger and bigger storage. Some disks directly attached to server machines cannot satisfy the required capacity, stability and performance. Therefore there has been research to make huge storage systems with many storage machines connected by a high speed network. It used to be focused on making one huge storage volume. But currently they are providing many volumes dedicated for many virtual machines.

## How to start?

I received an email asking how to start. Unfortunately, there is no King's Road to [King's Landing](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/King%27s_Landing). I will just write what I did in order. If you have already done something, please skip it. AGAIN, this is just an example that you could do in order, just in case if you do not know how to start or what to do.

* Reading OS theory books: 
* Learn assembly and C
  * [8086 assembly programming with emu8086](https://github.com/gurugio/book_assembly_8086)
    * It is enough if you understand the concept of assembly programming. You do not need to do something practical.
  * [The C Programming Language 2nd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=60R1D2CHBA8DHYT6JNMN)

  * Any C Programming Book
* Do something practical with C
  * C Project Based Tutorials: Find one or two interesting projects and make your own project.
  * [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/): If you cannot find an interesting project, it would be also good to focus on data structure and algorithm.
* Do a hardware project
  * Raspberrypi or Arduino does not matter. You need experience to control a hardware directly with only C. ONLY C!
  * I recommend to buy a ATmega128 kit and make a firmware to turn on/off LEDs, detect switch input and display message on the text LCD. Motor control program is also a very good project: for instance, the line tracer.
  * DO NOT use any library. You should make everything on your own, except program downloader.
* Basic of the Linux kernel
  * Low-level programming is very close to the operating system. You should know inside of the OS.
  * Start with drivers
    * Read [Linux Device Driver](https://www.amazon.com/Linux-Device-Driver-Development-development/dp/1803240067)
    * [Linux device driver labs](https://linux-kernel-labs.github.io/)
    * [The Eudyptula Challenge](http://eudyptula-challenge.org/)
  * Read a book on Linux Kernel Development to understand the internal of Linux kernel.
* Go to the professional field
  * If you want to be a professional Linux Kernel Developer
    * must make a toy kernel
      * [Learn operating system development using Linux kernel and Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/s-matyukevich/raspberry-pi-os)
      * [Make your own kernel](http://wiki.osdev.org/Getting_Started)
      * Write the github link to your kernel on your resume (Don't forget to write the detailed description in commit message)
    * Check the latest issues at https://lwn.net/ and join it.
      * Check "Recent kernel patches" at "https://lwn.net/Kernel/" or direct link https://lwn.net/Kernel/Patches
      * Find an interesting patch to you. Try to understand the source code. Of course it would be really difficult but try. You will be closer and closer whenever you try.
      * Build kernel and test it on your system. For example, performance test, stability test with LTP(https://linux-test-project.github.io/) or static code analysis tools inside of kernel.
      * Report any problem if you find any: compile warnings/errors, performance drop, kernel panic/oops or any problem
      * If it works well, report that with the spec of your system. The patch owner would write a "Reviewed-by" tag with your name.
      * Find your name in kernel git log
  * Or find other topics
    * There are many fields where the low-level engineer can work: security, Compiler, Firmware, robot/car and so on
